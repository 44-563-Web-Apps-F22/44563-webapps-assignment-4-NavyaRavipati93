    <h4> Sceneâ€”Exterior of Sir Marmaduke's mansion by moonlight. All the
        peasantry are discovered asleep on the ground, as at the end of
        Act I.</h4>

    <h6>CHORUS</h6>
    <p>You very, very plain old man,
        She loves, she loves you madly!</p>
    <h6>NOTARY</h6>
    <p> I am a very deaf old man,
        And hear you very badly!</p>

    <h6>CONST. </h6>
    <p> I know not why I love him so;
        It is enchantment, surely!
        He's dry and snuffy, deaf and slow
        Ill-tempered, weak and poorly!
        He's ugly, and absurdly dressed,
        And sixty-seven nearly,
        He's everything that I detest,
        But if the truth must be confessed,
        I love him very dearly!
        Oh!</p>

    
    <p> You're everything that I detest,
        But still I love you dearly!</p>

    <h6>CHORUS. </h6>
    <p> You've everything that girls detest,
        But still she loves you dearly!</p>

    <h6>NOTARY. </h6>
    <p> I caught that line, but for the rest,
        I did not hear it clearly!

        (During this verse Aline and Alexis have entered at back
        unobserved.)</p>


    <h6>NOTARY </h6>
    <p> Oh joy! oh joy!
        The charm works well,
        And all are now united.</p>

    <h6>CHORUS. </h6>
    <p> The blind young boy
        Obeys the spell,
        And troth they all have plighted!
