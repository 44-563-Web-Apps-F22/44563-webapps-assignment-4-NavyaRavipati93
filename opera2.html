    <p class="song"> How joyful they all seem in their new-found
        happiness! The whole village has paired off in the happiest
        manner. And yet not a match has been made that the hollow world
        would not consider ill-advised!</p>
    <h6 class="CHORUS name">CHORUS</h6>
    <p class="song"> But we are wiser—far wiser—than the world.
        Observe the good that will become of these ill-assorted unions.
        The miserly wife will check the reckless expenditure of her too
        frivolous consort, the wealthy husband will shower innumerable
        bonnets on his penniless bride, and the young and lively spouse
        will cheer the declining days of her aged partner with comic
        songs unceasing!</p>
    <h6 class="NOTARY name">NOTARY</h6>
    <p class="song"> What a delightful prospect for him!</p>
    <h6 class="CONST name">CONST</h6>
    <p class="song"> But one thing remains to be done, that my happiness
        may be complete. We must drink the philtre ourselves, that I may
        be assured of your love for ever and ever.</p>
    <h6 class="CHORUS name">CHORUS</h6>
    <p class="song"> Oh, Alexis, do you doubt me? Is it necessary that
        such love as ours should be secured by artificial means? Oh, no,
        no, no!</p>
    <h6 class="CONST name">CONST</h6>
    <p class="song"> My dear Aline, time works terrible changes, and I
        want to place our love beyond the chance of change.</p>
    <h6 class="NOTARY name">NOTARY</h6>
    <p class="song"> Alexis, it is already far beyond that chance. Have
        faith in me, for my love can never, never change!</p>
    <h6 class="CHORUS name">CHORUS</h6>
    <p class="song"> Then you absolutely refuse?</p>
    <h6 class="CONST name">CONST</h6>
    <p class="song"> I do. If you cannot trust me, you have no right to
        love me—no right to be loved by me.</p>
    <h6 class="NOTARY name">NOTARY</h6>
    <p class="song"> Enough, Aline, I shall know how to interpret this
        refusal.</p>
